/**
 * Inbound delivery — hand a socket message to the LOCAL agent.
 *
 * PRIMARY PATH: `cur.pi.sendUserMessage(text)` on the CURRENT context's pi
 * with default semantics — streaming queues as steer, idle starts a turn,
 * plan mode folds it into context. No registry lookup, no own-agent-id
 * discovery, no drop-for-undiscovered: the host's bus copy is unreachable
 * from a compiled extension, so delivery goes through the extension-host
 * surface that is always live on the current context.
 *
 * STRUCTURAL RULE: the session is NEVER snapshotted at boot. The current
 * `{pi, ctx}` comes from a live getter (refreshed on every host event).
 * Over-budget wakes queue as asides
 * (`pi.sendUserMessage(text, {deliverAs:'aside'})`), as does delivery on a
 * bridgeless host — and always on the CURRENT pi, never a
 * factory-captured one.
